# Bootstrap-Portfolio


## Description

This project is part of the 'Front-end web design & UX' course which is part of the online course with Birmingham University.
A porfolio is required in order to showcase projet work that you are proud of.  In this case it was mainly developed using Bootstrap in order to provide basic ready made code.
Using Bootstrap does solve many problems including that of writing code which may initially have mistakes.  It allows concentration to go on more important issues.
I have learned many things, largley due to trial and error, solving problems when they arise and recognising what may be going wrong.
